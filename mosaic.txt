; Hi all,
; After trying out the standard factions, I got to wondering what would happen if Unity had
; included one dedicated to the preservation and advancement of all the culture and art the
; travellers left behind. Kind of a half-museum, half-artists colony.
; The name comes from the fact that they had to gather up and piece together myriad
; artistic traditions and works. The basic idea is that they had to strike a difficult
; balance between keeping the past intact, but also moving civilization ahead, so the
; faction has an internal split between the creators and preservers - which allows a bit of
; gameplay freedom over which course to take.
;
; This started off as a joke, but it got to be fun to play. They seemed pretty balanced at
; Transcend level, when I played them in place of the Believers.
;
; Also, thanks to ANX for ACEdit 1.2!
