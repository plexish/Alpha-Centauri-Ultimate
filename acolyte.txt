thought. Rather than we focusing on caring for the needs of our 
own respective people, we are instead ignoring them and throwing 
them towards our enemies. This is madness, $NAME1. Surely you must 
share my thoughts and agree that this must end, for the good of 
our people."

"I agree, $NAME3. This mad war must end, right now."
"My concentration is far from confused. You must fall $NAME3!"

unity."

"Why not, $NAME3. Let's sign that treaty."
"No. I would like to leave your 'thoughts' at a safe distance."
