Those who join us need give up only half of their humanity—the illogical,
ill-tempered, and disordered half, commonly thought of as ‘right-brain’

personalities can only be attributed to archaic evolutionary tendencies.

“Our strategic simulations predict an inevitable stalemate for this
conflict, $NAME1. We therefore attach a high value to Blood Truce at this time.”

“I need no simulation to tell me that, $NAME3. Blood Truce is the best choice.”
“That’s funny … our simulations predict your inevitable defeat. We see no value in a Blood Truce.”

“You have recently demonstrated enhanced left-brain activity, $TITLE0 $NAME1.
A Treaty of Friendship would exponentially increase our mutual capabilities.”

“Your conclusions are irrefutable. A Treaty is the only rational path for our people, $NAME3.”
“I prefer my right-brain impulses on this one, $NAME3. You can use what’s left of yours.”
