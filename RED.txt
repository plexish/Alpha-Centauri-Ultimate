#BLURB
^  Although all citizens of The Red Unit are connected
to the Command Web, they can function without it. Like
those on Earth who invented the first atom bombs, there
is more than one "key" to the Web, and many control
it. We have made it unhackable.

"As our simulations suggest that nothing can be gained
from this conflict, a pledge of Blood Truce would
seem sensible."

"Indeed. Blood Truce would be most satisfactory."
"Never! I plan to put you offline for good!"

#FACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, I feel you would greatly benefit from
the web. Shall we sign a Treaty of Friendship and I'll
give you drone-level access codes?

"I'm interested. But I want citizen-level at least."
"No. You are not someone we wish to ally with, $NAME3."

"As our simulations suggest that nothing can be gained
from this conflict, a pledge of Blood Truce would
seem sensible."

"Progenitor: perceive no point either. Mutual agreement:
truce."
"Your needs: truth: not same. Continued conflict: beneficial
to Progenitor!"

#ALIENFACTIONTREATY

#caption $CAPTION7
"$TITLE0 $NAME1, the web might not be designed to
accommodate Progenitor minds, but we have much in
common nonetheless. Could we sign a Treaty
of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"RUnit: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"RUnit: web: not understood. Ally: dangerous. Answer:
no."
