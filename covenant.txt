#BLURB
In the deepest reaches of Planet's oceans, the crushing pressure and lack of nourishing 
sunlight render the hadal trench zones barren of most forms of life. Yet in this hellish 
environment, the xenofungus thrives in greater abundance and concentration than anywhere 
on the surface. Fused into dense clusters by intense geothermal heat and over 1200 bars of
deep sea pressure, the neural capacity of the hadal fungus is magnitudes larger than the
rest of Planet's xenomass put together. In these fathomless depths, Planet's very soul lies
dreaming.
