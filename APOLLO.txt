#BLURB
^We were born into a world where those with the ability
to create were hamstrung by the narrow visions of those
who could not, and where the worker was denied his dues by the 
social parasites who profited from his toil. But we have been
given a chance to forge a new society free of such inequities,
where the laborer who sweats under this foreign sun will 
receive in full the fruits of his activity.
