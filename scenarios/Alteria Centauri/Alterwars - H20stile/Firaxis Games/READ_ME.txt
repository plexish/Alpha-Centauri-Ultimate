  Captain Svensgaard, Command Nexus of the "Scourge of Armagon"

  ENGINEERING: "Captain, the Colony Police hit us very hard! Warp core breach is imminent!"
  CAPTAIN:     "Sensors, status report!"
  SENSORS:     "Sir, sensor arrays found a m-class planet in this system. 
               It´s rather small and wet, but the environment seems to be suitable."
  CAPTAIN:     "Damn Colony Police, i thought our informants were reliable. 
               I expected in that mining colony no worthy resistance. They traited us. 
               Well, back to our actual problems. Navigator, prepare standard orbit 
               around that waterhole."
  NAVIGATOR:   "Yes Sir! Course laid in!"
  SENSORS:     "Captain, Police vessels closing. Thir weapons are locked on us!"
  CAPTAIN:     "Initiate evasive maneuvers. Engineering, what´s about that warp core?!"
  ENGINEERING: "Sorry Captain, we have to eject it in about 60 seconds! 
               We can´t do anything!"
  1.OFFICER:   "Captain, without the warp core, weapons will not func...
               Sir! Hull breach at deck 2, direct hit!"
  CAPTAIN:     "Navigator, can we hold orbit?"
  NAVIGATOR:   "Captain, our only chance is an emergency landing!"
  ENGINEERING: "Warp Core ejected, Sir!"
  CAPTAIN:     "Holy nebula! We are going down! All crewmates abandon ship! 
               Save all valuable supplies, maybe we´ll need it!"
  1.OFFICER:   "Sir, Police vessels are leaving. It seems we made it."
  CAPTAIN:     "Maybe, but what awaits us on the surface?"
