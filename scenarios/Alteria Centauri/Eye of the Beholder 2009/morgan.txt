^  Human behavior is economic behavior. The particulars may vary,
but competition for limited resources remains a constant. Need
as well as greed have followed us to the stars, and the rewards
of wealth still await those wise enough to recognize this deep
thrumming of our common pulse.

"$NAME1, your lack of interest in human commerce makes you a
natural ally, for we have no point of contention. Shall we
sign a Treaty of Friendship and work toward other common goals?"
