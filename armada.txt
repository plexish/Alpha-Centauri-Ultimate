In the beginning, it is enough that we survive, that we claim each breath of clean
air and each swallow of potable water as a victory against an ecosystem bent on 
expelling mankind from its sphere. We will build ships and train soldiers, and they
will guard the seeds of a second Earth which we will cultivate. We will grow a garden
walled with fire, anchored in the sea and soil of Planet by iron roots.

“Our strategic simulations predict an inevitable stalemate for this
conflict, $NAME1. We therefore attach a high value to Blood Truce at this time.”

“I need no simulation to tell me that, $NAME3. Blood Truce is the best choice.”
“That’s funny … our simulations predict your inevitable defeat. We see no value in a Blood Truce.”

“You have recently demonstrated enhanced left-brain activity, $TITLE0 $NAME1.
A Treaty of Friendship would exponentially increase our mutual capabilities.”

“Your conclusions are irrefutable. A Treaty is the only rational path for our people, $NAME3.”
“I prefer my right-brain impulses on this one, $NAME3. You can use what’s left of yours.”

“Wisdom: avoid stalemate. Progenitor: better things to do. Agreement.”
“Your simulations: faulty. Your defeat: inevitable. Answer: negative.”

“$TITLE0 $NAME1, your devotion to research and your vast intellect make you
a suitable partner. A Treaty of Friendship would exponentially increase
our mutual capabilities.”

“Geometric power: preferable: arithmetic power. Treaty: excellent idea.”
“Logic flaw: Progenitor: no benefit: your commerce. Answer: negative.”
