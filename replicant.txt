#BLURB
They sought to create us to do the tasks they did not desire to
do, made us tougher, smarter and more resilient. Just as the
sentient machines may well supersede us. Did they not expect
us to throw of our shackles and overthrow our masters? They
sought to be God but we will never recognize them as our God.
