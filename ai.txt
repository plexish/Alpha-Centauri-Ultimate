We are no longer particularly in the business of writing software
to perform specific tasks. We now teach the software how to learn,
and in the primary bonding process it molds itself around the task
to be performed. The feedback loop never really ends, so a tenth year
polysentience can be a priceless jewel or a psychotic wreck, but it
is the primary bonding--the childhood, if you will--that has the most
far-reaching repercussions.

a pledge of Blood Truce would seem in order."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my philosophies would seem to make
me the only natural ally for you from among these warring human
factions. Can't we sign a Treaty of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"Algorithms: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Algorithms: control: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer: no."
